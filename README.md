# Whitney Houston and the influence on baby names
In the second week project, I decided to analyze the influence of great artists in the name of children born and registered between the 70s to 10s.
<br />
The chart shows a parallel between the year when Whitney Houston released the music I Wanna Dance With Somebody in 1987 and how much the name grew in the number of American records compared to the previous ones.
<br />
I made just a sample of how much we are influenced by pop culture in our daily lives.
